The goal of this site is to allow anyone - no matter their budget - to download high-quality assets to use in their commercial projects.

DevAssets is built on the idea of **pay what you want** pricing. That means that newer developers can get top-quality assets at a price they can afford and that the more established developers can choose to chip in to support a good cause.

The website is built and mantained by <a href="http://youtube.com/brackeys/" target="_blank">Brackeys</a> but many of the assets on the site is created by independent artists. If you want to become part of the project feel free to [throw us an email](mailto:apply@brackeys.com).
